# planeFinder
Python program that reads in raw ADS-B and filters based on ICAO number. 
I have found it easiest to connect to a raw tcp dump coming fom 
an instance of dump1090

This program requires pyModeS which can be found at:
https://github.com/junzis/pyModeS

Currently in development, this should be taken as alpha at best.  

Arguments: 
-c config file location 
-i ipaddress (not a hostname) 
-p port 

python planefinder.py -i <IPAddress> -p <PORT> -c <FILENAME>
